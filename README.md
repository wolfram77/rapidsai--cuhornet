This is a fork of [cuhornet], where i am trying to measure the graph loading
performance of cuhornet (orginally called [hornet]). Below is the
reading/loading time, (hornet) initialization time, and total time for
performing a few iterations of Katz centrality on a number of graphs - obtained
from [sheets].
